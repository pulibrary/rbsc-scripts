        <bioghist>
            <p>William E. Fredeman was a prominent professor, scholar, and collector of Victorian
                literature and Pre-Raphaelitism. Born in 1928 in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Fredeman
                pursued his BA at Hendrix College. After receiving his PhD in English at the
                University of Oklahoma in 1956, he joined the faculty at the University of British
                Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, where he taught until 1991. Best known for his book
                    <emph render="italic">Pre-Raphaelitism, A Bibliocritical Study</emph> (Harvard
                University Press, 1965), Fredeman also wrote a major two-volume study of Dante
                Gabriel Rossetti's letters, and contributed to many major projects, including four
                volumes of the <emph render="italic">Dictionary of Literary Biography</emph>, <emph
                    render="italic">The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood Journal</emph>, the collected
                letters of William Bell Scott, and numerous articles and books on Dante Gabriel
                Rossetti, William Morris, Alfred Tennyson, and the Victorians. From the 1950s
                through the 1990s, he was also a well-known and avid collector of books, artwork,
                and manuscripts related to the Pre-Raphaelites and their circle, and his vast
                collection drew many scholars and researchers in the field. He died in 1999.</p>

                <p>The collection includes personal and family papers of William Bell Scott
                    (1811-1890), a Scottish poet, painter, art critic, and occasional engraver,
                    known for his association with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in London, founded
                    by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Holman Hunt, and John Everett Millais. Also
                    present are personal and family correspondence and an estate document of Scott's
                    life partner and mistress, Alice Boyd (1824-1897). William Bell Scott met Alice
                    Boyd, also a painter, in London in 1859. They began a relationship that lasted
                    for the rest of Scott's life. Beginning in the 1860s, Scott and his wife Letitia
                    lived with Boyd in the summer and fall, while the three resided together at
                    Scott's house in London during the other half of the year. Penkill Castle, the
                    family estate in Ayrshire, Scotland, which Alice Boyd owned, served as an
                    occasional refuge for many artists and writers associated with the
                    Pre-Raphaelite circle, including the Rossetti family, William Morris, and W. J.
                    Linton. Scott completed many books and paintings while in residence, and died at
                    the castle in 1890, leaving many of his papers.</p>
                <p>Scott's materials include manuscripts, drafts, and corrected page proofs for
                    poetry and prose writings, drawings and sketches, engraving proofs,
                    correspondence, record books of print sales, inscribed books, binding dummies,
                    and personal documents, such as an address book and passport. Also included are
                    many important official documents, autograph letters and ancillary holograph
                    material regarding the Scott family, including William Bell Scott's brother, the
                    painter David Scott (1806-1849), their father, the engraver Robert Scott
                    (1777-1841), grandfather Robert Scott, and great-grandfather George Scott. Alice
                    Boyd's papers include personal and family correspondence, as well as an estate
                    document regarding her grandfather, William Losh, and an unsigned manuscript
                    chronicling the history of Alice Boyd and the Pre-Raphaelites at Penkill Castle.
                    A small group of related materials, with holograph poems by others and
                    clippings, is also included.</p>

                    <p>This series includes writings, artwork, personal correspondence, and
                        documents of William Bell Scott, as well as family papers following his
                        paternal family line through four generations. Scott, a close friend and
                        associate of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and other central Pre-Raphaelites, was
                        active in several fields, generating written work as a poet, art critic, and
                        memoirist, and visual work as an engraver, painter, and teacher of the
                        ornamental arts. The variety of materials present in this series reflects
                        the diversity of Scott's artistic practice. These materials include
                        manuscripts, drafts, corrected page proofs, notes, sketches, print proofs of
                        engraved illustrations, print sales records, binding dummies, errata slips,
                        and bound printed volumes for many of William Bell Scott's major works in
                        poetry, prose, and art, as well as for projects to which he contributed
                        writing or illustrations. Also included are assorted early drafts of
                        individual poems and essays, along with various informal notes, stencils,
                        and drawings. His correspondence relates to publishing projects and
                        events.</p>
                    <p>Family papers consist of correspondence, estate papers, writings, drawings,
                        and official documents regarding feudal property rights, marriage, and
                        guildry for the Scott family, including William Bell Scott's brother David
                        Scott (1806-1849), a known historical painter; his father, the engraver
                        Robert Scott (1777-1841); his grandfather, also named Robert Scott; and
                        great-grandfather, George Scott. William Bell Scott's descriptions of most
                        of the earlier family documents present in this series can be found in his
                        discussion of the Scott family ancestry in pages 9-17 of <emph

                            <p>A significant group of manuscript materials exist relating to Scott's
                                final volume of poetry, <emph render="italic">A Poet's Harvest
                                    Home</emph>, first published by Elliot Stock in 1882, and again
                                years later with an "aftermath" of additional poems, published by
                                Elkin Mathews and John Lane in 1893. Of note is a complete bound
                                manuscript, which William Bell Scott copied out by hand, day by day,
                                for several months in 1881 as a gift for Alice Boyd. The manuscript,
                                which contains various corrections, additions, and deletions, also
                                served as a mock-up for the printed volume. Also present are many
                                drafts of individual poems that appeared in <emph render="italic">A
                                    Poet's Harvest Home</emph>, including a group of poems William
                                Bell Scott wrote during a flurry of activity in the late 1870s and
                                early 1880s during his time at Penkill Castle.</p>
                            <p>Materials related to other published works, including drafts, page
                                proofs, and print proofs of engraved frontispieces for the 1854 and
                                1875 editions of <emph render="italic">Poems</emph> are also
                                present, along with notes for chapters of his autobiography, binding
                                dummies and title-page mock-ups for books to which he provided
                                engraved illustrations, notes regarding his contributions to
                                encyclopedias, and manuscripts of essays and letters published in
                                various journals. Several bound volumes are additionally included,
                                some containing original prints of Scott's engraved work, as well as
                                a few association copies of his books inscribed to friends. Also of
                                note are several of Scott's sketches for a proposed addition to
                                Penkill Castle in the 1870s and 1880s, following the completion of
                                his murals on the castle's staircase.</p>
                            <p>In addition to his individual pursuit of poetry, painting, and
                                engraving, Scott served as the master of the Government School of
                                Design at Newcastle-on-Tyne for over twenty years. Accordingly,
                                these files also contain assorted ornamental drawings and sketches,
                                woodcut illustrations, and decorative stencils related to Scott's
                                study of design and ornamental arts.</p>

                            <p>This file group includes personal correspondence of William Bell
                                Scott, primarily letters received, regarding books and publishing,
                                the work of other writers and artists, and invitations to events. A
                                significant portion of the correspondence, dated 1887, consists of
                                letters thanking William Bell Scott for gifted copies of <emph
                                    render="italic">The Illustrations to the King's Quair</emph>, an
                                edition of engravings Scott published that year based on his
                                paintings at Penkill Castle.</p>
                            <p>Of note is a letter from William Morris regarding a work contract
                                that Scott held with Morris, as well as Morris's impressions of
                                Stonehenge and his decision to take up tapestry work. Also present
                                is a detailed letter from William Bell Scott's brother, David Scott,
                                regarding his views on art. Several postcards from William Bell
                                Scott, along with a watercolor valentine addressed to Alice Boyd,
                                can be located among her personal correspondence.</p>

                                <p>This lengthy letter contains David Scott's answers to many
                                    questions on art and philosophy that William Bell Scott had
                                    posed to him over the years. William Bell Scott published his
                                    brother's memoirs in 1850, likely using many of these insights
                                    therein.</p>

                                notes on his models and travel arrangements, a passport bearing many
                                stamps from his frequent trips to Italy and France in the 1850s and
                                early 1860s, calling cards for Scott and Alice Boyd, and an envelope
                                of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's monogram stamps that Scott kept with his
                                effects. Also present is a small document box bearing Scott's

                                including prices, type, and location information for artwork sold
                                between 1870 and 1884.</p>

                        <p>David Scott (1806-1849), a Scottish historical painter, was the older
                            brother of William Bell Scott. This file group includes correspondence,
                            an essay manuscript, and estate papers kept by William Bell Scott, who
                            inherited his brother's property upon his death, as well as compiled his
                            memoirs.</p>
                        <p>Of note are two lengthy holograph letters from David Scott to his father
                            describing his experiences while studying painting in Rome in 1833 and
                            1834. An additional letter, from David Scott to William Bell Scott
                            describing his philosophy and practice of art, can be found with William
                            Bell Scott's personal correspondence.</p>

                    <p>Alice Boyd's correspondence is followed by family correspondence, arranged
                        alphabetically by sender, with other documents and manuscripts at the
                        end.</p>

                <scopecontent>
                    <p>This series includes materials related to William Bell Scott's companion,
                        Alice Boyd, and her family, primarily personal and family correspondence
                        related to the Boyd, Courtney, and Losh families, along with one estate
                        document. Alice Boyd owned Penkill Castle in Ayrshire, where William Bell
                        Scott, among other known Pre-Raphaelite artists and associates, resided
                        while working on various creative projects. Present is Boyd's correspondence
                        with some of these figures regarding their visits to the castle, as well as
                        her correspondence with publishers and other parties regarding Scott's work
                        after his death. Family correspondence pertains mainly to the family's
                        alkali business and the status of Penkill Castle, and also includes W.J.
                        Linton's condolences to the heirs of Alice Boyd following her death in 1897.
                        One family document is also present, regarding the disposition of the
                        property of William Losh, Boyd's grandfather, following the sale of his
                        alkali works business, as well as an unsigned manuscript by an unknown
                        relative of Alice Boyd from the late 1890s, titled "The History of an Old
                        Ayrshire Mansion," which documents the life of Alice Boyd and several major
                        Pre-Raphaelites at Penkill Castle.</p>
                    <p>Items of note include a letter from Christina Rossetti to Alice Boyd,
                        following a visit to the castle in the late 1860s, as well as a letter from
                        Spencer Boyd, Alice's brother, describing his visit to Penkill Castle prior
                        to their residence.</p>
